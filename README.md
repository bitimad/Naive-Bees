# Naive-Bees-Image-Loading-and-Processing

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, we will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. we'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline, then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.
